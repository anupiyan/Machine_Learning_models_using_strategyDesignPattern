# ML_strategyDesignPattern
Simple approach of using strategy design pattern for Machine Learning Solutions. This enables us to simply call the machine learning model without knowing all the internal functionality. It also enables us to change the models without changing much of the main class code.

The data for general practice can be found at:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yashpaloswal/fraud-detection-credit-card?select=creditcard.csv

The data for the explainability approach in the models can be found at:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction

install the requirements:
pip install -r requirements.txt

set up the config file to: pass the data, select the machine learning algorithm and if you wanted to do predictions or explainability.
To run the code, in the command prompt add the following command:
python main.py
